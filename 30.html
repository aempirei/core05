<p>Given k features, k-1 edges would exist in a linear corpus as opposed to k2-k if it were unordered.
<p style='color:gray'>A corpus would have to contain multiple training sets since most information modeled as unordered sets don’t typically have item repetition.
<p>A collection of open ports on a host will never contain the same port twice, nor will the order in which the ports are listed make a difference.
<p style='color:gray'>The digram ‘TH’ may occur many times in a single sentence and the order of ‘T’ and ‘H’ in the digram matters, as “HT” is distinctly different.
<p>Given a collection of sets, recursively replace the most common two-feature pair across all sets with a new token and an expansion rule.  Once no two-feature pair occurs more than once, stop.  For any dictionary symbol occurring only once across all expansion rules and main corpus, expand the symbol and delete the expansion rule.
