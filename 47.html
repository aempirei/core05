<p>Lexical cohesion is the characteristic continuity of semantic mean of text.
<p>Lexical cohesion is a direct result of a body of writing “being about the same thing.”
<p>For example, a group of sentences in a paragraph are not random and disconnected.   Rather, they coherently “stick together.”
<p>The study of cohesion, lexical or otherwise, is quite possibly the most important component of linguistics.
<p>There are two main types of cohesive relationships, reiteration and collocation, and Halliday and Hasan go further to classify cohesion into five categories based on specific word dependency relationship.
<p>Reiteration and collocation can be described in effectively simpler terms.
<p>Reiteration involves the repetition of lexical items across sentences.
