<p>NMAP is an open source tool for network exploration.
<p>In a nutshell, NMAP performs host discovery, port scanning, operating system detection, and now application discovery.
<p>In terms that we care about, NMAP provides us with a set of characteristics that describe a given host.
<p>Characteristics are unordered, i.e. that the order in which open ports on a given host are listed provides no real information, only the fact that they are either open or closed.
<p style='color:red'>INSERT NMAP SCAN COMMAND LINE
<p>Because scan reports are in a plain textual format, all of the characteristics which we are interested in are parsed out.
