<font size="+2" face="Arial">

<p>One way security analysts can glean insight into security holes is through security patches.
<p>Patches are effectively the exact description of a security flaw and its addressed fix.
<p>One assumption that patches make and is clearly true based on the fact that patches in fact do work, is that programs are modular.
<p>Modification of a single portion of code does not necessarily impact the syntactical representation of the rest of the program.
<p>From this assumption, it follows that we can expect that we can extrapolate the flaws and changes across two versions of a program simply by looking at their difference.
<p>If a program were not modular, the difference would be too widespread to come to an understanding simply from their binary difference even though the programs are functionally, semantically, similar.
