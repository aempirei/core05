<p>In bioinformatics, a sequence motif is a widespread nucleotide or amino-acid sequence that is believed to have some sort of functional significance.
<p>In program code, standard functional calls, such as printf(), are quite common.
<p>Rules that define sequence motifs that can vary in structure are often created.  
<p>Rules are actually expressed as regular expressions, not unlike POSIX regex.
<p>Probabilistic rules in the form of Markov Models are even created.
<p>These regular expression rules are very similar to the way that binary analysis is performed to find simple vulnerable conditions.
<p>For example, searching for strcpy() as the sign of a buffer overflow is done by searching for the sequence motif it generates in binary program code.
<p>Many tools and IDA scripts automate this process and have even been quite effective in finding numerous security holes.
